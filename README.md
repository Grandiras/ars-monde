# Ars Monde

Yearning for a place where talents bloom and mana flows?
Ars Monde opens a brand-new realm steeped in the magic of Ars Nouveau. Gather Source, harvest rare plants, and test your spellcraft far from the clutter of the Overworld!

(Requires Ars Nouveau and Ars Monde Lib – the pack will not load without them.)

## Key Features
- Mana-rich ecosystem – Dozens of Ars Nouveau plants generate naturally, from Sourceberry bushes to colorful Archwood forests.
- Mystical fauna – Encounter Drygmys, Wilden, Bookwyrms, and other Ars creatures at balanced spawn rates.
- Amethyst abundance – Large veins and geodes spawn throughout the dimension, perfect for crafting glyph presses, conduits, and decorative builds.
